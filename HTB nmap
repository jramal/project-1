Nmap's TCP ACK scan (-sA) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (-sS) or Connect scans (sT) because they only send a TCP packet with only the ACK flag.
When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an RST flag. Unlike outgoing connections, all connection attempts (with the SYN flag) from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls. 
However, the packets with the ACK flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.

-sS	Performs SYN scan on specified ports.
-sA	Performs ACK scan on specified ports.
-Pn	Disables ICMP Echo requests.
-n	Disables DNS resolution.
--disable-arp-ping	Disables ARP ping.
--packet-trace	Shows all packets sent and received.


--source-port 53	Performs the scans from specified source port.

eg : PORT      STATE SERVICE
     50000/tcp open  ibm-db2
     MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

     ncat -nv --source-port 53 10.129.2.28 50000
